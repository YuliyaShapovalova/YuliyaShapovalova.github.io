I am an assistant professor at the data science group of [the Institute for Computing and Information Sciences](https://www.ru.nl/icis/), Radboud University Nijmegen. I am interested in combining mechanistic and machine learning methods, uncertainty quantification, and various time series applications (inspired by the fields of bioinformatics, genomics, and econometrics, but not limited to them). My latest research is closely connected to Gaussian processes and physics-informed machine learning. 

Previously I worked as a postdoc in the machine learning group of [prof. Tom Heskes](https://www.cs.ru.nl/~tomh/) at the Institute for Computing and Information Sciences, Radboud University Nijmegen. My research during this period focused on probabilistic machine learning for drug-drug interaction and mixture toxicity data. Before joining Radboud University, I worked as a research associate in the group of [prof. Magnus Rattray](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/magnus.rattray.html), where I was first exposed to Gaussian processes (GPs) and carried this line of research with me up to this day. We, in particular, focused on the application of GPs to RNA-seq data. I received my PhD from Maastricht University with the thesis "Bayesian inference in multivariate nonlinear state-space models", supervised by [dr. Michael Eichler](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/nl/m.eichler).
