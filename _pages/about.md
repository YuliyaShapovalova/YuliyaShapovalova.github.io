I am a postdoc in the machine learning group of [prof. Tom Heskes](https://www.cs.ru.nl/~tomh/) at the Institute for Computing and Information Sciences, Radboud University Nijmegen. My research focuses on Bayesian statistics and machine learning with applications in various fields (bioinformatics, genomics, econometrics). Among other things, I am currently working on combination of machine learning and mechanistic approaches to drug-drug interactions. 

Under supervision of [dr. Michael Eichler](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/nl/m.eichler), I received my PhD from the Maastricht University with the thesis "Bayesian inference in multivariate nonlinear state-space models". Subsequently, I have also worked at Manchester University in the group led by [prof. Magnus Rattray](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/magnus.rattray.html), combining mechanistic models with Gaussian processes for modeling RNASeq data. 

I am interested in combining mechanistic and machine learning methods, uncertainty quantification, and various time series applications within Bayesian statistics and machine learning fields. I continue working on making multivariate non-linear state-space models scalable through combinations of the "exact" and approximate methods (SMC/MCMC and VI). I also actively work on the application of Gaussian processes (GPs) to RNASeq and proteomic data through a combination of GPs and biologically plausible mechanistic models. My recent interests also include encoding mechanistic assumptions into neural networks (Granger-causality, PDEs).
