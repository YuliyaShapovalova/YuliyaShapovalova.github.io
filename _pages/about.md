I am an assistant professor at the data science group of [the Institute for Computing and Information Sciences](https://www.ru.nl/icis/), Radboud University Nijmegen. I am working on machine learning methods and their applications to complex data (such as graphs and time series) in various fields. The application domains include other scientific fields, such as biology, genomics, and econometrics, as well as industrial applications (e.g., energy and energy transition). Some of the ongoing research work also includes machine learning for weather and climate applications. 

Our group is actively working on bridging the gap between science and society/real-world applications. For example, at Radboud University, we are actively working with Alliander on the challenges of energy transition in the Netherlands. I lead the AI and data science theme in this [collaboration](https://www.ru.nl/en/about-us/organisation/partners-and-networks/alliander). Furthermore, with the MKB data lab, we aim to strengthen the regional applications of AI, which benefit small and medium-sized companies. Are you a student interested in real-world experience? Are you a company that wants to incorporate machine learning and AI in your business? Check out the MKB data lab [here](https://www.ru.nl/en/about-us/news/mkb-datalab-oost-helps-companies-with-the-implementation-of-artificial-intelligence). 

Previously I worked as a postdoc in the machine learning group of [prof. Tom Heskes](https://www.cs.ru.nl/~tomh/) at the Institute for Computing and Information Sciences, Radboud University Nijmegen. My research during this period focused on probabilistic machine learning for drug-drug interaction and mixture toxicity data. Before joining Radboud University, I worked as a research associate in the group of [prof. Magnus Rattray](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/magnus.rattray.html), where I was first exposed to Gaussian processes (GPs), and I continue this line of research up to this day. I received my PhD from Maastricht University with the thesis "Bayesian inference in multivariate nonlinear state-space models", supervised by [dr. Michael Eichler](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/nl/m.eichler).
