If you are currently a student at Radboud University, I am regularly updating available Master thesis and internship projects (including those in collaboration with industry) on our [group page]([https://www.ru.nl/datascience/education/masters-specialisation/](https://das.cs.ru.nl/Projects)).

Interested in working on Gaussian process, time series, graph neural networks, applications in climate and weather? Then get in touch, there's often room to form an additional project related to these topics. 

Some of the previous master thesis projects
